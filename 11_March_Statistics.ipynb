    "#### To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if there is a significant difference in student performance between the two teaching methods, we need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "##### The null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in student performance between the two teaching methods, meaning that the population means are equal:\n",
    "###### H0: μA - μB = 0\n",
    "##### The alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that there is a significant difference in student performance between the two teaching methods, meaning that the population means are not equal:\n",
    "###### Ha: μA - μB ≠ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Step 2: Determine the significance level and the appropriate test statistic\n",
    "##### The significance level (α) is 0.01. Since the population standard deviations are unknown and the sample sizes are small, we will use a two-sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Step 3: Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "##### We can calculate the test statistic using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### t = (X̄A - X̄B) / (sqrt(Sp^2/nA + Sp^2/nB))\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Where X̄A and X̄B are the sample means, Sp^2 is the pooled variance (calculated as (nA-1)sA^2 + (nB-1)sB^2 / (nA+nB-2)), nA and nB are the sample sizes, and sA and sB are the sample standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Substituting the values given, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### t = (85 - 82) / (sqrt(((496^2)+(645^2))/(49+64-2) * (1/49 + 1/64)))\n",
    "###### = 2.28 (rounded to two decimal places)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Step 4: Determine the p-value\n",
    "##### The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed test statistic, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Since this is a two-tailed test, we need to find the area under the t-distribution curve to the left of the negative test statistic (-2.28) and to the right of the positive test statistic (2.28) with (49+64-2) = 111 degrees of freedom. Using a t-distribution table or calculator, we find that the p-value is less than 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Step 5: Make a decision\n",
    "##### Since the p-value (less than 0.01) is smaller than the significance level (0.01), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that we have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in student performance between the two teaching methods at a significance level of 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### In conclusion, the results of the t-test indicate that the two teaching methods have a significant difference in student performance, and we reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that the samples are representative of their respective populations and that the data meets the assumptions of normality and independence."
